UK Data Controllers, from ICO website, as a [Data Package](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages)

This is preliminary work towards a directory of organisations to be used with [getyourdata.org](getyourdata.org)

Origin of data: https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/what-we-do/register-of-data-controllers/download-the-register/

This git repository only contains part of the data, because it is too large to store in github. The entire CSV file from ICO is about 1.5Gb.

I have stored the data package with all of the rows at the address: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/uk-data-controllers/datapackage.json
